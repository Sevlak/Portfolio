# William's Portfolio

Hey! My name is William, and this is my portfolio. Be advised: this was made as a side project so that I could learn
more about the .NET ecosystem and its features. The code will probably be full of unnecessary comments and some weird
explanations. Don't sweat it, they are just for me :)

If you still chose to proceed and read my code, be my guest. Open an issue to give feedback or advice on something about
the code, I'm all ears!

I chose to use Razor Pages on this project because it's simple, cool (I always liked the Razor syntax and wanted to play with)
and it seemed like a good starting point.
